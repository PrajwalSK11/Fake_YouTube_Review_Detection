Fake video identification on social media platforms is a genuine issue in today's society, and it has become increasingly widespread and difficult to identify.  The detection of it in its early stages is a serious difficulty. Another issue in false video identification is the scarcity of tagged data for the model. To address the previously mentioned problem, this work provides a novel false video detection framework based on aspect-based sentiment analysis.  The information from the video reviews from the social environment is used by the purpose framework.

Using Python Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis(Pyabsa) pretraindes model to extract aspect and its sentiments.

PyABSA is a Python tool for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, simplifying sentiment analysis by focusing on specific aspects in text. It uses advanced NLP methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze sentiment towards different aspects. PyABSA extracts aspects, categorizes them, and identifies sentiment polarity, enabling users to track sentiment patterns and make informed decisions. Businesses and researchers benefit from its customizable features and intuitive interface.

The test.py used the dataset created by us, and done the pre-processing on it and after all the advance processing we applied the pre-trained mode i.e ATEPC aspect extractor,to extract the aspect and its sentiment from the text.

Then aspect_extract.py uses the API technique to extract the comments froom the youtube video URL at real time and does all the advance processing and then using pre-trained model to extract the aspect and its sentiment from the text.
